 This presentation introduces a flexible framework that shifts assessment from a content-focused approach to a skill-based, process-oriented learning, empowering students to co-create rather than rely on AI tools. The framework promotes writing as a process of inquiry, collaboration, and critical engagement, encouraging students to reflect on their use of AI while developing academic and professional competencies. Through practical examples, we will demonstrate how instructors can design assignments that cultivate transferable skills essential for success in an AI-integrated world. Educators will gain tools to foster meaningful co-creation in writing classrooms that balance innovation with intention.''')

   Inas Mahfouz is an associate professor of language and linguistics at the American University of Kuwait. She is also chair of the English Department where she teaches a variety of language courses and academic writing. Her current research projects include: (1) meta-discourse markers in academic writing: a cross-cultural study which she started during her fellowship at the Writing center at Dartmouth College in Summer 2017 and (2) the Arab Learner English Corpus (ALEC): a corpus of Freshman writing hosted by the Learner Corpus Association. Teaching second language writing and examining learners' corpora have made her realize multilingual writers bring diverse cultural background to their writing classes which shape how they adopt and apply the guidelines of academic writing.''')

 Did the chatbot get it right?
 The extensive use of chatbots, fueled by their easy accessibility, has transformed instructors' approach to academic writing. This transformation is particularly significant in English Second Language (ESL) writing, where linguistic proficiency poses challenges for students who often struggle to articulate their thoughts and construct meaningful sentences.
 This case study explores how AI can enhance the teaching process. Students enrolled in a second-level college writing course are required to utilize two different chatbots to generate content for various writing tasks. Using rubrics provided by their instructor, students audit the AI-generated content, decide how far it fulfills the requirements of the tasks to determine whether to proceed with a submission, develop, or edit certain sections.
 Students reflect on the process and what they gained and their reflections are analyzed using Geisler and Swarts (2019) frame for qualitative data analysis.''')

 Nowadays, it seems like everything is “coached”—athletes, executives and now even writing center specialists. But what does coaching actually mean in an academic setting? A team of writing specialists from Qatar University’s English Foundation Program recently completed an intensive coaching training program. In this session, we will explore some of the coaching strategies that may enhance writing center pedagogy. Participants will have the opportunity to try out practical coaching techniques that can be applied in tutoring sessions. Additionally, the presenter will share insights on whether coaching tool have successfully improved interactions with students and colleagues in her daily operations. The session will conclude with an open discussion and Q & A, inviting attendees to reflect on the role of coaching in writing center practices.''')

 In this talk, we will discuss what constitutes an authentic writing style as opposed to formulaic and standardized. We will compare and contrast authentic student-produced and AI-generated texts in order to single out key language features that account for the differences. It is these linguistic differences that usually give away AI-generated writing by making it sound formulaic, “too polished”, and therefore lacking in voice and authenticity. We will compare these features with students’ views based on the findings of a survey on students’ perceptions of quality writing. The similarities and differences in features and perceptions can inform our classroom practices and policies, as well as become a starting point for a conversation with our students about the value of an authentic voice in writing.''')

 Student writers, especially those working in foreign languages, tend to cede authority to external tools—websites, AI chatbots, library books, paper mills--because of the disorientation they experience in higher education. Using Stegmaier’s (2019) theory of orientation and Bartholomae's (1986) idea of students “inventing the university”, this paper first theorizes the adjustments students need to make as they move from novice to proficient writers, a process which happens in the communities shaped by their general education classes, in their fields of study, and in the broader scholarly conversation. During this transition, professors and tutors can foster student agency by bringing generative AI and other digital tools into the classroom. This presentation will conclude with some models for using cooperative learning to explore AI's jagged frontier in structured classroom activities followed by metacognitive reflection.''')

   Mitchell Atkinson teaches the construction of academic and philosophical texts at the undergraduate and graduate levels, helping young researchers read across discursive divisions. He is an instructor and organizer for the genetic phenomenology network and works periodically with the Husserl Archive. He also has several years of experience tutoring language learners, especially young people writing in their second language. In his work, Alterity and the Flint Water Crisis, Atkinson returned to his home city to understand the lived experience of the residents of Flint and the ways in which the crisis has informed their expectations for the future. This required a new analysis of the phenomenology of social invisibility as partially constituting the contemporary exercise of power. Atkinson is also a writer of fiction and a moderately skilled manipulator of the electric fretted bass guitar.''')

 The following paper attempts to involve three until now disparate lines in my research. The first is the phenomenology of emotional experience. The second is internalized forms of marginalization (self-othering). The third is writing pedagogy. Taking examples from my own work as a teacher of writing, I attempt to analyze the tendency among some students to “over-use” digital tools of all kinds to “polish” the life, and often the meaning content, out of their writing. A phenomenology of shame can alert us to one of the most pressing dangers faced by educators—especially in the humanities—today. Shame, as Husserlian phenomenology can show us, is a self-directed axiological emotion which takes as its object not the act but the person. If the aim of pedagogical work is to enrich the person, to give the person the intellectual, social, and cultural tools concomitant with a full and elevated adult life, then combatting and preempting certain forms of shame experience should be central to the teacher’s work. The flight into digitally-mediated experience, into chatbots and ersatz online worlds, can be partially motivated by a constituted self-valuation which prevents the subject (the student) from expecting certain forms of achievement. This recoiling from expectations relative to growth and personal development is anti-pedagogical. The acts which contribute to it form an antipedagogy. The ways in which AI-mediated experiences contribute to such recoiling should be urgently studied. I offer the structure of play experience as a form of mediation which may encourage self-transvaluation for some students in some cases. ''')

 In this presentation, a writing program director discusses the collaborative development of a statement of 'Principles of Teaching Critical AI Literacy' that has guided our critical engagement with AI technologies in undergraduate writing seminars and writing center tutorials. In particular the presenter share survey data about AI use among first-year students at our U.S.-based university and also detail practical activities and assignments to engage students in critically and ethically using AI to generate ideas, analyze audiences, and conduct research for writing. The presenter will also share examples of our programmatic effort to bring more student voices into the AI conversation in higher education by developing a collaborative class project across multiple sections in which students created original multimedia web content about AI use in writing, learning, and creative arts.''')
