 This presentation introduces a flexible framework that shifts assessment from a content-focused approach to a skill-based, process-oriented learning, empowering students to co-create rather than rely on AI tools. The framework promotes writing as a process of inquiry, collaboration, and critical engagement, encouraging students to reflect on their use of AI while developing academic and professional competencies. Through practical examples, we will demonstrate how instructors can design assignments that cultivate transferable skills essential for success in an AI-integrated world. Educators will gain tools to foster meaningful co-creation in writing classrooms that balance innovation with intention.''')

   Inas Mahfouz is an associate professor of language and linguistics at the American University of Kuwait. She is also chair of the English Department where she teaches a variety of language courses and academic writing. Her current research projects include: (1) meta-discourse markers in academic writing: a cross-cultural study which she started during her fellowship at the Writing center at Dartmouth College in Summer 2017 and (2) the Arab Learner English Corpus (ALEC): a corpus of Freshman writing hosted by the Learner Corpus Association. Teaching second language writing and examining learners' corpora have made her realize multilingual writers bring diverse cultural background to their writing classes which shape how they adopt and apply the guidelines of academic writing.''')

 Did the chatbot get it right?
 The extensive use of chatbots, fueled by their easy accessibility, has transformed instructors' approach to academic writing. This transformation is particularly significant in English Second Language (ESL) writing, where linguistic proficiency poses challenges for students who often struggle to articulate their thoughts and construct meaningful sentences.
 This case study explores how AI can enhance the teaching process. Students enrolled in a second-level college writing course are required to utilize two different chatbots to generate content for various writing tasks. Using rubrics provided by their instructor, students audit the AI-generated content, decide how far it fulfills the requirements of the tasks to determine whether to proceed with a submission, develop, or edit certain sections.
 Students reflect on the process and what they gained and their reflections are analyzed using Geisler and Swarts (2019) frame for qualitative data analysis.''')

 Nowadays, it seems like everything is “coached”—athletes, executives and now even writing center specialists. But what does coaching actually mean in an academic setting? A team of writing specialists from Qatar University’s English Foundation Program recently completed an intensive coaching training program. In this session, we will explore some of the coaching strategies that may enhance writing center pedagogy. Participants will have the opportunity to try out practical coaching techniques that can be applied in tutoring sessions. Additionally, the presenter will share insights on whether coaching tool have successfully improved interactions with students and colleagues in her daily operations. The session will conclude with an open discussion and Q & A, inviting attendees to reflect on the role of coaching in writing center practices.''')
